		<h2>About me</h2>
		<img src="img/kitten.jpg" alt="A kitten that represents me">
		<p>I am a Seattle native that attended the University of Washington. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Biology. I decided to take the intro to programming class because I tried coding and absolutely loved it! I am thinking about switching careers into the tech field. Currently, I work in the biotech industry development processes to create clinical drugs of all types from blood coagulation medicines to cancer therapies. Some of my hobbies are snowboarding, reading, and I espcially love traveling!</p>
